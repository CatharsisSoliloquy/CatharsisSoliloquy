## Welcome to my space on GitHub!


### Greetings to all! ðŸ‘‹
#### About me
My name is **Josue Sangucho** (You can also call me **Catharsis**), proudly graduated from the **Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del Ecuador** in **Information Technology Engineering**. My passion for technology has led me to embark on a journey of continuous learning and constant adaptation to the latest technological trends. I'm currently learning React JS, TypeScript, Node, etc. I love the development world especially front-end development.
I am open to connections and opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects. I firmly believe in the synergy that comes from collaboration and the exchange of ideas. Contributing to mutual success is one of my main goals, and I'm excited about the possibilities this can bring.
Thanks for visiting my corner on GitHub. I hope you find here inspiration, interesting projects and, perhaps, the beginning of a fruitful collaboration. Do not hesitate to contact me for any question, idea or proposal!
